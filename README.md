# bombsquadmod
A small mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead which adds new professions.

I inspired myself with this forum post:
https://discourse.cataclysmdda.org/t/we-make-terrible-suggestions-and-come-up-with-horrible-ideas-round-ii/17444/792?u=sticker

This is as much a readme as it is a project map for me.

This mod seeks to add a bomb squad technician profession, and a CBM equipped variant. Both will spawn with an active mininuke.
Hopefully I can accomplish making them spawn on a randomized (but reasonable) timer.
If I feel more comfortable working with JSON by the end of that, I might consider adding an NPC of the same sort.
